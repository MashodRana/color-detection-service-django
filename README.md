Detect the colors present in an image through pixel extraction and by clustering pixels.

Color detection service implemented with django as web application.

The purpose of this project is provide the Machine Learning service through web.

We can build API to use Machine Learning algorithm on our web applications.

## Used Machine Learning Techniques
**Extract pixels:** by detecting `contours` or `foreground`.

**Clustering pixels**: To identify the colors name `K-means` clustering algorithm is used.

## Dependencies:
  `Python 3.6.12`
  
  `Django 2.2`
  
See the `requirements.txt` file for other dependencies.
